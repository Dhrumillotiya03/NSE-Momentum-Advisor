# stock_ai — Project Context

## What this is
Quant momentum trading system for NSE India. Not a toy project — this is being
prepared for real capital deployment via Zerodha. Side income goal, not day trading —
decisions made weekly/monthly.

## Machine / environment
- Ubuntu, Anaconda `base` env, Python
- ALL scripts must be run from `scripts/` — they use relative paths (`../data/`)
- Never run scripts from repo root or anywhere else, paths will break

## Strategy (currently backtested, don't casually re-tune without re-running full backtest)
- Cash equity only (no derivatives), vol-adjusted momentum, monthly rebalance (21 trading days).
- TRADING UNIVERSE (2026-07 migration): gated to F&O-liquid names only — top
  UNIVERSE_TOP_N (~200) of the broad Nifty200+500 pool by trailing 20d median
  turnover (Close x Volume), recomputed point-in-time at every rebalance date
  (see core.liquid_universe() / backtest_portfolio.liquid_symbols_at()). This is
  a LIQUIDITY PROXY, not a static F&O symbol list — deliberately survivorship-bias-
  free (a fixed F&O roster applied backward across 2015-2026 would inflate
  backtested returns, since NSE's F&O list didn't look like today's in 2015).
  Market regime/breadth still reads the FULL broad universe — the gate applies
  only to what gets bought, not how the market is read. See memory
  fno-universe-migration for the full rationale.
- 3-layer: (1) Nifty50 regime filter Bull/Sideways/Bear (breadth-gated, broad
  universe) (2) momentum scoring on the F&O-gated universe (3) inverse-vol
  position sizing with regime-based exposure.
- Params (all in scripts/strategy_config.py, the single source of truth): 126-day
  lookback, 50-day MA filter, RSI 80 overbought cap (advisory), -18% catastrophic
  stop only (no tight intra-hold exits — validated to cost Sharpe/CAGR by
  whipsawing out of momentum trends), 20% max position, sector cap 2/sector
  (enforced in backtest_portfolio.select_top_n_capped — was documented but NOT
  actually enforced in code until the F&O migration surfaced up to 8/10 names in
  one sector during BULL rebalances). REGIME_NAMES SIDEWAYS=3 (was 6, changed
  2026-07 after a walk-forward study found 6 names diluted the few genuinely
  good SIDEWAYS setups — 3 names beats/matches 6 in 16/19 windows; 2 names was
  tested and rejected for worse tail risk, don't re-tune below 3).
- HARD MONTHLY CLOSE: the book goes fully flat at every month-end (exit_engine.py)
  — user mandate, not just a rebalance. No intra-month profit-taking beyond the
  -18% stop (tested and rejected twice — see memory trading-mandate-constraints).
- Current backtest (F&O-gated universe, SIDEWAYS=3, full 2015-2026 history):
  16.2% CAGR, Sharpe 0.88, max DD 36.8%. Walk-forward (19 overlapping 3y
  windows): mean CAGR 21.2%, median 22.4%, mean Sharpe 1.09, 18/19 windows
  Sharpe-positive. Trust the walk-forward distribution (python walk_forward.py),
  not any single backtest run — see memory feedback-quant-researcher-role for why.

## S/R subsystem (separate, already tuned — don't touch unless directly asked)
- `support_resistance.py` — multi-timeframe (monthly+weekly+daily) swing pivots +
  volume profile + wick rejection + delivery volume scoring + reach probability
- Backtested via `sr_backtest.py` (fast, uses `fast=True` flag — REQUIRED or it hangs,
  wick_rejection_score becomes iterrows-based without it) and `sr_backtest_filtered.py`
  (only tests on trend+momentum+regime-filtered conditions)
- Current accuracy: ~65-68% combined S/R hit rate on 21-day forward window — this is
  close to the practical ceiling for price-only daily S/R, don't chase higher without
  a clear new hypothesis
- `sr_daily_logger.py` logs daily S1/R1 always, S2/R2 only if reach-prob beats the
  empirical base rate (~66%, from sr_reach_table.json). WATCHLIST is a FIXED
  hardcoded validation panel — same stocks every day so sr_monthend_analysis.py
  measures accuracy on a consistent panel; do NOT make it dynamic. Runs via cron
  weekdays 6pm (scripts/run_daily_log.sh)
- `sr_dynamic_logger.py` — SEPARATE dynamic watchlist (holdings + top-10 F&O-gated
  momentum) logging to sr_dynamic_log.csv, for extra forward calibration data on
  deployment-relevant names. Never merge it with the fixed panel above. Analyse via
  `python sr_monthend_analysis.py --log ../data/sr_dynamic_log.csv`
- ETF data (GOLDBEES) lives in `data/etf_data/` (download_etf.py), NOT price_data/ —
  price_data is globbed as the universe by core.market_breadth_pct/liquid_universe,
  and a high-turnover ETF there would enter the tradable top-200 and could get bought
  by the strategy. support_resistance.load_stock and sr_monthend_analysis fall back
  to etf_data/ automatically
- `sr_monthend_analysis.py` checks hit-rate, level drift, probability calibration,
  n-sensitivity, distance-vs-accuracy — run only after 2-3+ weeks of logged data

## Known gotchas — do not rediscover these the hard way
- yfinance miscategorizes RELIANCE as IT sector — always trust sectors.json
- Midcap150 was tried and removed — caused survivorship bias, don't re-add
- ADANIENT.NS.NS.csv-style double-suffix bugs have happened before in build_universe.py —
  watch for `.NS.NS` when adding new download logic
- get_levels() in support_resistance.py MUST be called with fast=True in any backtest
  loop over many stocks/dates, or wick_rejection_score's iterrows path makes it hang
- Ollama must be running locally (port 11434) before running ai_assistant.py (needs a
  tool-calling-capable model, e.g. qwen2.5 — llama3 does NOT support tool-calling)
- RCOM is a dead/delisted stock in the portfolio (~₹0.92) — exclude from any S/R or
  accuracy analysis, it's a write-off not a trading position
- Don't apply today's F&O symbol list backward across historical backtests — that's
  survivorship bias (NSE's F&O roster changes ~2x/year). Use the point-in-time
  liquidity proxy (core.liquid_universe / backtest_portfolio.liquid_symbols_at)
  instead — see memory fno-universe-migration
- A truncated/interrupted download write can leave a malformed last CSV row
  (e.g. SUNDARMFIN.NS.csv had a row missing its Date field) that parse_dates
  silently fails on WITHOUT producing NaT — it survives as a literal string in
  the index and can break anything that sorts by date. core.load_stock and
  backtest_portfolio.load_price_matrix now guard against this explicitly
  (pd.to_datetime(..., errors="coerce") + filter); other CSV loaders in the
  repo don't yet — if you hit a sort_index TypeError, check for this first
- UNIVERSE_TOP_N (~200) is anchored to NSE's real F&O roster size, NOT tuned for
  backtest performance — sensitivity to this number is noisy/non-monotonic
  (150→13.8% CAGR, 200→17.0%, 250→14.4%, 300→17.0%), so don't re-tune it off
  backtest results, that's curve-fitting
- sectors.json sector classifications for the 136 F&O names added in the 2026-07
  migration were filled in from general knowledge, not verified against a live
  authoritative source — good enough for the diversification cap, worth a manual
  skim eventually

## My preferences
- Direct, no filler. Exact file names + line numbers, not vague descriptions.
- Show current code before showing replacement.
- Don't explain "why this is best practice" unless I ask — I want the change, not the lecture.
- When testing changes to the S/R or strategy engine: one variable at a time, re-run
  backtest, report before/after numbers, revert if it doesn't help. Don't bundle
  multiple untested changes together.
- Flag anything that risks overfitting to my specific 3-year backtest window before
  I implement it.
